# CanonStrata

Constitutional, load-bearing architectural substrate.

## System Identity

1. Not a stack
2. Not a framework
3. Not a toolkit
4. Not a starter, template, theme, or library
5. Outlives vendors
6. Refuses invalid code

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

### Existence Test
1. Analytics disappear → system holds
2. CRM disappear → system holds
3. Cache disappear → system holds
4. Motion disabled → layout holds
5. Tokens missing → build fails
6. Rules broken → compile fails

### Repository Immutability
1. Only source-of-truth code may exist
2. No generated artifacts
3. No backups, temp scripts, reports, ad-hoc files
4. Artifact drift causes immediate build failure
5. No discretionary retention

### System Prohibitions (Compile-Time)
1. No inline styles
2. No non-token CSS
3. No SaaS coupling
4. No unauthorized motion
5. Client misuse → lint error

### Design System
1. Token-first system
2. No hardcoded styles
3. No business logic in UI

### Motion Governance
1. Reduced-motion support mandatory
2. Motion disabled → layout intact
3. Only CanonStrata kernel motion allowed

### Token Gates
1. Missing token → build fails
2. Hardcoded value → lint failure

## Refusal Contract

The system refuses to compile on violation.

Enforcement mechanisms:
- AST checks
- CI rules
- Runtime assertions

## Immutability Clause

This is a structural operating system for websites.
A permanent load-bearing architecture.
A foundation that never changes.

It hosts without change:
- Contractor sites
- SaaS sites
- Internal tools
- Public platforms

It is not:
- A marketing site
- A theme
- A component library

## Prime Directive

1. Do not add
2. Lock everything
3. Perfect the foundation
4. This is not a website
5. This is a load-bearing megastructure
